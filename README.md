## üî® Building for Production

To build the extension for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

For specific browser targets:

```bash
# Firefox
pnpm build:firefox

# Brave
pnpm build:brave

# Edge
pnpm build:edge

# Opera
pnpm build:opera
```

## üì¶ Packaging

To package the extension for distribution:

```bash
pnpm package
```

For Firefox:

```bash
pnpm package:firefox
```

## üîë Chrome Web Store Submission

To submit your extension to the Chrome Web Store, you'll need to:

1. Generate a `keys.json` file with your Google API credentials:
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Chrome Web Store API
   - Create OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret)
   - Generate a refresh token

2. Format your `keys.json` file as follows:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlasmoHQ/bpp/v3/keys.schema.json",
     "chrome": {
       "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
       "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
       "refreshToken": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN",
       "extId": "YOUR_EXTENSION_ID"
     }
   }
   ```

3. For more detailed instructions on submitting to the Chrome Web Store, refer to the [Plasmo documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit).

## üîê CRX Private Key

For Chrome extension packaging, you'll need a private key file (`crx.pem`). If you're creating a new extension:

1. Plasmo will automatically generate this file during the first build
2. Keep this file secure and don't commit it to your repository

If you're working with an existing extension, you'll need to obtain the original private key file.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
